                abstract={This paper describes a novel scheme for automatic identification of a species from its genomic data. Random samples of a given length (10,000 elements) are taken from a genome sequence of a particular species. A set of 64 keywords is generated using all possible 3-tuple combinations of the 4 letters: A (for Adenine), T (for Thymine), C (for Cytosine) and G (for Guanine) representing the four types of nucleotide bases in a DNA strand. These 43= 64 keywords are searched in a sample of the genome sequence and their corresponding frequencies of occurrence are determined. Upon repeating this process for N randomly selected samples taken from the genome sequence, an N {\texttimes} 64 matrix of frequency count data is obtained. Then Principal Component Analysis is employed on this data to obtain a Feature Descriptor of reduced dimension (1 {\texttimes} 64). On determining the feature descriptors of different species and also by taking different samples from the same species, it is found that they are unique for a particular species while wide differences exist between those of different species. The variance of the descriptors for a given genome sequence being negligible, the proposed scheme finds extensive applications in automatic species identification.},

                abstract = {Radiative communication using electro-magnetic (EM) fields amongst the wearable and implantable devices act as the backbone for information exchange around a human body, thereby enabling prime applications in the fields of connected healthcare, electroceuticals, neuroscience, augmented and virtual reality. However, owing to such radiative nature of the traditional wireless communication, EM signals propagate in all directions, inadvertently allowing an eavesdropper to intercept the information. In this context, the human body, primarily due to its high water content, has emerged as a medium for low-loss transmission, termed human body communication (HBC), enabling energy-efficient means for wearable communication. However, conventional HBC implementations suffer from significant radiation which also compromises security. In this article, we present Electro-Quasistatic Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC), a method for localizing signals within the body using low-frequency carrier-less (broadband) transmission, thereby making it extremely difficult for a nearby eavesdropper to intercept critical private data, thus producing a covert communication channel, i.e. the human body. This work, for the first time, demonstrates and analyzes the improvement in private space enabled by EQS-HBC. Detailed experiments, supported by theoretical modeling and analysis, reveal that the quasi-static (QS) leakage due to the on-body EQS-HBC transmitter-human body interface is detectable up to 0.15 m, whereas the human body alone leaks only up to 0.01 m, compared to 5 m detection range for on-body EM wireless communication, highlighting the underlying advantage of EQS-HBC to enable covert communication.},

                abstract = {Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain, promises extreme efficiency for certain classes of learning tasks, such as classification and pattern recognition. The performance and power consumption of neuromorphic computing depends heavily on the choice of the neuron architecture. Digital neurons (Dig-N) are conventionally known to be accurate and efficient at high speed, while suffering from high leakage currents from a large number of transistors in a large design. On the other hand, analog/mixed-signal neurons are prone to noise, variability and mismatch, but can lead to extremely low-power designs. In this work, we will analyze, compare and contrast existing neuron architectures with a proposed mixed-signal neuron (MS-N) in terms of performance, power and noise, thereby demonstrating the applicability of the proposed mixed-signal neuron for achieving extreme energy-efficiency in neuromorphic computing. The proposed MS-N is implemented in 65 nm CMOS technology and exhibits  100X better energy-efficiency across all frequencies over two traditional digital neurons synthesized in the same technology node. We also demonstrate that the inherent error-resiliency of a fully connected or even convolutional neural network (CNN) can handle the noise as well as the manufacturing non-idealities of the MS-N up to certain degrees. Notably, a system-level implementation on MNIST datasets exhibits a worst-case increase in classification error by 2.1{\%} when the integrated noise power in the bandwidth is 0.1 uV2, along with +-3 amount of variation and mismatch introduced in the transistor parameters for the proposed neuron with 8-bit precision.},

                abstract = {This article presents a broad review on optical, radio-frequency (RF), microwave (MW), millimeter wave (mmW) and terahertz (THz) biosensors. Biomatter-wave interaction modalities are considered over a wide range of frequencies and applications such as detection of cancer biomarkers, biotin, neurotransmitters and heart rate are presented in detail. By treating biological tissue as a dielectric substance, having a unique dielectric signature, it can be characterized by frequency dependent parameters such as permittivity and conductivity. By observing the unique permittivity spectrum, cancerous cells can be distinguished from healthy ones or by measuring the changes in permittivity, concentration of medically relevant biomolecules such as glucose, neurotransmitters, vitamins and proteins, ailments and abnormalities can be detected. In case of optical biosensors, any change in permittivity is transduced to a change in optical properties such as photoluminescence, interference pattern, reflection intensity and reflection angle through techniques like quantum dots, interferometry, surface enhanced raman scattering or surface plasmon resonance. Conversely, in case of RF, MW, mmW and THz biosensors, capacitive sensing is most commonly employed where changes in permittivity are reflected as changes in capacitance, through components like interdigitated electrodes, resonators and microstrip structures. In this paper, interactions of EM waves with biomatter are considered, with an emphasis on a clear demarcation of various modalities, their underlying principles and applications.},

A novel built-in alternate tuning test is used to explicitly evaluate all the DUT specifications at each optimization iteration. For large parameter deviations well beyond the test specification limits of the DUT, determination of the different specification values is difficult. Such devices are tuned using a golden response tuning approach which optimizes the DUT specifications implicitly until the DUT is "good enough" to be tuned by the prior Augmented Lagrange algorithm.

The quality of received image/video content depends on the effective bit error rate of the communication channel and the amount by which the image/video data is compressed prior to transmission. For a specified value of received signal quality (as determined by PSNR), the combination of the two that results in minimal RF energy consumption is first determined via an optimization procedure. Then across varying channel conditions, the baseband signal is companded and power is saved by re-biasing the RF power amplifier (PA), while maintaining the "optimal" transmission bit error rate value determined in the first step. Closed loop feedback control is used to guarantee that the received image/video quality remains within the limits set by the user. For a range of PSNR values, the average Energy/image inPA reduces by 50{\%}, where the reference is a static system without channel quality and image quality adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

In the recent past, there has been work on diagnosing RF device model parameters from random frequency-rich test stimulus. In this paper, we develop a novel test stimulus generation approach which produces a compact, deterministic test stimulus in such a way that the RF DUT model parameters can be computed directly from the DUT response (called the DUT signature). This is achieved through use of a non-linear solver that adjusts the DUT model parameters iteratively until the model response to the applied test matches the observed DUT test response signature. It is shown that a small set of optimized tones in the frequency domain or an optimized transient waveform in the time domain can be used as test stimulus. It is shown how the use of embedded sensors in the RF design can expedite model parameter diagnosis. The practicality and accuracy of the proposed diagnosis approach is shown through simulations and hardware measurements. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Prior "alternative" test methods have achieved fast testing at the cost of using supervised learning algorithms that require "training". In contrast, behavioral model parameter estimation based test methods require the use of accurate models but no "training" is necessary, reducing test deployment costs. In this work, a new test generation approach is proposed that allows behavioral model parameter estimation to be performed from a single optimized OFDM data frame. A genetic multi-tone test stimulus optimization algorithm is developed to maximize the accuracy with which a nonlinear solver can determine RF transceiver model parameters from raw downconverted test response data. The transceiver model proposed is the most comprehensive to date and includes AM-PM distortion and 5th order nonlinearity effects. Simulation results show that using the optimized multitone test stimulus, all the model parameters can be computed accurately using a single data acquisition (4X-5X faster than prior parameter estimation techniques and comparable to alternative test times). Data from an experiment performed on a hardware prototype validates the proposed concept. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Effective adaptation requires built in tuning knobs in the RF front end circuits. Due to the sensitive nature of RF circuits traditional turning knobs affect more than one specification simultaneously. To ensure optimal adaptation it is beneficial to have carefully designed tuning knobs that allows independent control of important specifications. In this paper the design of an inductorless RF LNA is discussed whose specifications can be traded off independently/orthogonally of each other for reduced power consumption. Two built in tuning knobs are introduced for orthogonal adaptation of Gain and linearity. The proposed LNA, designed in 0.18 CMOS achieves a 14 dB Gain and 30 dB OIP3 control range as its power consumption goes down by 20. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Both top-down and bottom-up analysis techniques are supported by hierarchical RF behavioral models. The health (effects of process variations) of individual modules affects the relationship between module level tuning parameters and module level performance metrics and is factored into the tuning procedure.

Such a controller needs careful calibration and suffers from modeling inaccuracies which must be guardbanded during real-time operation resulting in "less than optimal" power consumption. In this work we propose a real time fuzzy noise-distortion control algorithm for low-power adaptation of the RF front-end to continuously changing channel conditions. As opposed to prior techniques, the proposed control algorithm handles adaptation to channel attenuation and fading as well as in-band and out- of- band interference, taking advantage of signal and interferer estimation techniques that are already incorporated in modern transceivers. In the proposed technique, the RF front-end controller automatically finds an optimal power-performance trade-off point in real-time across a large gamut of channel conditions. It is seen that about 23{\%} savings in power consumption can be obtained over RF systems that are not capable of real-time adaptation. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

This problem is made worse by the increased number of adaptation settings ("tuning knob values") and the requirement of measuring specifications at all of these settings. In this paper, a new test technique is proposed that allows the closed loop performance of the adaptation procedure to be predicted from a set of open-loop tests. The optimal knob settings where the system should be tested in open-loop are found using a gradient based search algorithm and optimized test signals are generated such that the error in performance prediction across different tuning knob settings is minimized. The results of these tests are then mapped to the performance of the adaptive system which is validated implicitly without incurring large testing and tuning costs.

The goal is to achieve specified system-level EVM (Error Vector Magnitude) targets for MIMO receiver systems by tuning the individual MIMO receiver subsystems whose combined gain, noise and nonlinearity parameters determine the overall system-level EVM metric. While there has been prior work on tuning of SISO systems, the current work is novel due to the fact that the performances of individual receiver subsystems can combine in different ways to result in the same systemlevel EVM value. As the systems are tuned to meet the system level end-to-end metric it is ensured that all devices that are tuned for EVM consume the least amount of power possible. Tuning infrastructure for MIMO receivers and underlying tuning algorithms are developed in this work. A 1x2 MIMO system for a 2.4 GHz OFDM WLAN is used to demonstrate the core ideas of this research.

However, the difference in architecture results in differences in potential circuit impairments/fault models, leading to different test/measurement/calibration requirements. The delay skew between the envelope and phase signals and the finite envelope bandwidth can create inter modulation distortion that leads to the violation of the spectral mask and error vector magnitude (EVM) requirements. Therefore, measurement and compensation/calibration of these parameters are important to ensure proper operation for the polar transmitter. In this paper, we propose a technique to measure the delay skew and the finite envelope bandwidth based on the measurement of the 3rd order inter modulation distortion (IMD3) at the output of the transmitter. First, a two-tone input at a sufficiently low frequency is applied to the transmitter baseband input to calculate the delay. Then, we apply another two-tone input at a relatively higher frequency to determine the envelope bandwidth. Simulation and hardware measurement results show that the proposed technique can characterize the targeted impairments in the polar transmitter accurately within 10ms which is negligible compared to signal source switching and settling times. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

In the near term, DDR4 and GDDR5 are expected to meet the needs of server, client, graphics and mobile platforms [1]. Differential signaling with high-speed serial I/O enhancements will potentially continue I/O performance scaling for post-DDR4 and future buffered memory solutions. A unified memory interface that can meet the signaling requirements of all these memory standards offers several benefits: reduced cost and design time, greater platform design flexibility, and a smoother transition from DDR4/GDDR5 to a high-speed differential memory interface [2]. This paper presents a dual-mode TX that supports single-ended (SE) 1.2V-DDR4/1.5V-GDDR5 (hereafter referred to as DDR-mode) as well as high-speed differential signaling (hereafter referred to as HSD-mode), which is implemented using only thin-gate-oxide devices in 22nm CMOS. Other key design features include: (a) a DDR4/GDDR5 driver implemented using only active devices (no linearizing resistors), (b) enhanced voltage-mode driver supply regulation, (c) reconfigurable logic to support pre-emphasis in both TX modes, and (d) low-overhead digital clock-calibration techniques based on asynchronous digital sampling (ADS) to improve calibration coverage and accuracy. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

                abstract = {This paper details the design of an 8-lane bidirectional link for both within-the-box and external communications in 22 nm CMOS technology. A low profile connector with a high density cable assembly ensure a data rate of up to 32 Gb/s per lane while maintaining channel loss below 25 dB. Channel equalization is performed by a combination of a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), single-stage continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a 6-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Collaborative timing recovery is used to enable lane characterization without degrading jitter performance. Phase error decimation, with a conditional phase detection scheme, is used to reduce the DFE complexity by 50{\%}. Power consumption over a wide range of data rates from 4 to 32 Gb/s is reduced by using regulated CMOS clocking with lane bundling, low swing transmitter with a source-series terminated (SST) driver and a highly reconfigurable receiver with an active inductor CTLE. At a lane data rate of 32 Gb/s, over a 0.5 m cable with 16 dB of loss, a transceiver lane consumes 205 mW from a 1.07 V supply. The power scales down to 26 mW from a 0.72 V supply at 8 Gb/s, when transmitting over a channel with 8 dB loss. The active silicon area per lane is 0.079 mm2.},

In the past, designers have invented self-healing mechanisms that are tailored towards specific (critical) mixed-signal/RF performance metrics of specific circuit architectures (transmitter, receiver, etc). What is desired, however, is the ability to monitor multiple performance metrics concurrently and trade them off against one another in an optimal manner, through performance tuning mechanisms, to satisfy system-level Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. Further, the methods employed must be scalable across different device types/circuit architectures and supported by CAD tools that enable automation of self-healing design procedures. In this paper, recent research advances are presented that allow low cost and rapid self-healing of complex mixed-signal/RF systems and enable the development of design automation tools to support such activity across diverse performance metrics and circuit types.},

It is also known that the optimal power control strategy depends on the process conditions corresponding to the RF devices concerned. This complicates the problem of designing the feedback control system that guarantees the best control strategy for minimizing power consumption across all channel conditions and process corners. Since this problem is largely intractable due to the complexity of simulation across all channel conditions and process corners, we propose a self-learning strategy for adaptive MIMO-RF systems. In this approach, RF devices learn their own performance vs. power consumption vs. tuning knob relationships 'on-The-fly' and formulate the optimum reconfiguration strategy using neural-network based learning techniques during real-time operation. The methodology is demonstrated for a MIMO-RF receiver front-end and is supported by hardware validation leading to 2.5X power savings in minimal learning time.},

As device bandwidths expand, it becomes increasingly expensive, from a power consumption and reliability perspective, to operate such real-time systems for worst-case (static) performance requirements. In contrast, it is attractive to design algorithms, architectures and circuits that are power-performance tunable and can adapt dynamically, via self-learning techniques, to the requirements of system-level applications for extended battery usage and device lifetime. Such future systems will feed application level demands to the underlying algorithm-architecture-circuit design fabric through built-in sense-and-control infrastructure (hardware, software). The sense functions assess instantaneous application level demands (e.g. throughput, signal integrity) as well as the performances of the individual hardware components as determined by manufacturing process conditions. The control functions actuate algorithm-through-circuit level tuning knobs that continuously trade off performance vs. power of the individual software and hardware modules in such a way as to deliver the end-to-end desired application level Quality of Service (QoS), while minimizing energy/power consumption.

The communication fabrics that will handle this enormous amount of IoT workload will need to be energy-efficient under changing contexts such as channel conditions, applications, QoS, data-rate requirements etc. Moreover, the IoT devices will often include multiple parallel communication fabrics; e.g. wired, proximity, mm-wave, 5G etc. We will discuss how self-learning can enable context-aware operation in such communication systems to allow minimum energy/bit and energy/information for any given communication scenario. The need for context-aware operation within and among multiple physical layers (PHYs) in future IoT workloads will be highlighted.

These wearable devices are typically interconnected using wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an antenna. In this work for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering ({\textgreater}20 dB) of the interference for interference-robust HBC.},

Side-channel attack (SCA) is one of the prominent methods to break the security of an encryption system by exploiting the information leaked from the physical devices. Correlational power attack (CPA) is an efficient power side-channel attack technique, which analyses the correlation between the estimated and measured supply current traces to extract the secret key. The existing countermeasures to the power attacks are mainly based on reducing the SNR of the leaked data, or introducing large overhead using techniques like power balancing. This paper presents an attenuated signature AES (AS-AES), which resists SCA with minimal noise current overhead. AS-AES uses a shunt low-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by 400x in the supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in 130 nm CMOS technology. System-level implementation of the AS-AES along with noise injection, shows that the system remains secure even after 50K encryptions, with 10x reduction in power overhead compared to that of noise addition alone.},

The use of data mining techniques is indispensable for analysis of the large pool of data generated by the wearable devices. Deep learning is among the promising methods for analyzing such data for healthcare applications and disease diagnosis. However, the conventional deep neural networks are computationally intensive and it is impractical to use them in real-time diagnosis with low-powered on-body devices. We propose Staged Inference using Conditional Deep Learning (SICDL), as an energy efficient approach for creating healthcare monitoring systems. For smart diagnostics, we observe that all diagnoses are not equally challenging. The proposed approach thus decomposes the diagnoses into preliminary analysis (such as healthy vs unhealthy) and detailed analysis (such as identifying the specific type of cardio disease). The preliminary diagnosis is conducted real-time with a low complexity neural network realized on the resource-constrained on-body device. The detailed diagnosis requires a larger network that is implemented remotely in cloud and is conditionally activated only for detailed diagnosis (unhealthy individuals). We evaluated the proposed approach using available physiological sensor data from Physionet databases, and achieved 38{\%} energy reduction in comparison to the conventional deep learning approach.},

One promising application of such a network is wearable health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s) of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN. In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable connectivity with {\textgreater}8× power savings compared to Bluetooth low-energy (BTLE).},

We highlight important applications of Human-Internet and discuss the architecture of a wearable Human-Internet device capable of communicating through inter-body dynamic HBC. A custom-built hardware prototype is used to demonstrate for the first time information exchange (e.g. business card) during handshaking. Dynamic signal transfer characteristics during inter-body communication through handshake between two individuals wearing such devices are measured and analyzed. The effects of data transmission rate, handshake posture on the HBC based inter-body communication is explored to demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations under varying realistic scenarios.

To adapt an HVAC system to the dynamic environment and save energy without compromising the comfort level of the occupants, different techniques have been explored to sense the real-time occupancy in rooms, zones and buildings. Among all these approaches, wireless camera-based sensing is appealing for its intrinsic application potentials in surveillance and security besides energy management. However, limited life-time and detection accuracy, due to embedded energy storage and computation capability constraints, have prevented pervasiveness of wireless camera-based occupancy detection. This paper presents a novel wireless device platform and prototype development that incorporates IR camera with optical camera to provide collaborative intelligence at low-power and high-accuracy. Compared to an optical camera based baseline design, we demonstrate 65 $\chi$ improvement in miss rate, 5 $\chi$ reduction in detection false positive rate and 25{\%} lifetime extension for battery usage; and a maximum of 40{\%} HVAC energy savings compared to thermostat based control.},

State-of-the-art Internet of Things networks such as Nest also use open authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies. Taking inspiration from human communication, which utilizes inherent variations in the voice signatures to identify a certain speaker, we present RF-PUF: a deep neural network-based framework that allows real-time authentication of wireless nodes, using the effects of inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters (Tx), detected through in-situ machine learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. The burden of device identification is completely shifted to the gateway Rx, similar to the operation of a human listener's brain. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65-nm technology node, and features such as local oscillator offset and I - Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 Tx(s) with an accuracy of 99.9{\%} [≈99{\%} for 10000 Tx(s)] under varying

Fingerprint-based in-field biometric authentication combined with the conventional password-based techniques would ensure strong security of critical information delivery.

                abstract = {The threat of side-channels is becoming increasingly prominent for resource-constrained internet-connected devices. While numerous power side-channel countermeasures have been proposed, a promising approach to protect the non-invasive electromagnetic side-channel attacks has been relatively scarce. Today's availability of high-resolution electromagnetic (EM) probes mandates the need for a low-overhead solution to protect EM side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks. This work, for the first time, performs a white-box analysis to root-cause the origin of the EM leakage from an integrated circuit. System-level EM simulations with Intel 32 nm CMOS technology interconnect stack, as an example, reveals that the EM leakage from metals above layer 8 can be detected by an external non-invasive attacker with the commercially available state-of-the-art EM probes.
                Equipped with this 'white-box' understanding, this work proposes STELLAR: Signature aTtenuation Embedded CRYPTO with Low-Level metAl Routing, which is a two-stage solution to eliminate the critical signal radiation from the higher-level metal layers. Firstly, we propose routing the entire cryptographic core within the local lower-level metal layers, whose leakage cannot be picked up by an external attacker. Then, the entire crypto IP is embedded within a Signature Attenuation Hardware (SAH) which in turn suppresses the critical encryption signature before it routes the current signature to the highly radiating top-level metal layers. System-level implementation of the STELLAR hardware with local lower-level metal routing in TSMC 65 nm CMOS technology, with an AES-128 encryption engine (as an example cryptographic block) operating at 40 MHz, shows that the system remains secure against EM SCA attack even after 1M encryptions, with 67% energy efficiency and 1.23× area overhead compared to the unprotected AES.},

A set of 64 three-tuple keywords is first generated using the four types of bases: A, T, C, and G. These keywords are searched on N randomly sampled genome sequences, each of a given length (10,000 elements) and the frequency count for each of the 43 = 64 keywords is performed to obtain a DNA-descriptor for each sample. Principal Component analysis is then employed on the DNA-descriptors for N sampled instances. The principal component analysis yields a unique feature descriptor for identifying the species from its genome sequence. The variance of the descriptors for a given genome sequence being negligible, the proposed scheme finds extensive applications in automatic species identification. Next, a computational map is trained by the Self-Organizing Feature Map algorithm using the DNA-descriptors from different species as the training inputs. The map is shown to provide an easier technique for recognition and classification of a species based on its genomic data.},

Prior research has demonstrated that embedded RF sensors can generate significant information about RF circuit performance. In this paper, we propose a test methodology that enables efficient BIT and BIT-enabled tuning of RF systems. A test generation approach is developed that co-optimizes the applied test stimulus, the type of embedded sensors, and the system response capture mechanisms for maximal accuracy of the BIT procedure. This BIT technique is also used to perform diagnostic testing of the transmitter. The information gathered from diagnosis is used to tune the transmitter for improved performance. Simulation results demonstrate that BIT-assisted diagnosis and tuning can be performed with good accuracy using the proposed methodology. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2008 Vishwanath Natarajan et al.},

Using channel quality information for dynamic PAR adaptation, the proposed approach achieves a PAR reduction of as high as 7.25 dB, under favorable channels.

For example, high power, low power and shut down modes are available in some commercially available transceivers. If available, the tuning knobs affect different specifications in an interdependent manner, resulting in changing several specifications when only one needs to be tuned. This is not enough for power optimal operation of complete self-aware self-adaptive circuits and systems. Independent or orthogonal tunability of the important conflicting specifications using built-in tuning knobs allow optimal adaptation of the wireless systems. In this paper we demonstrate the design and benefits of orthogonal tuning knobs using an inductorless LNA as a test vehicle. The design of an orthogonally tunable LNA is discussed that has a 14 dB Gain tuning range and 30 dB OIP3 tuning range as its power consumption goes down by 20×. Measurement results on this LNA validate the concept of orthogonal tunability. Use of this orthogonally tunable LNA within an adaptive wireless receiver framework shows power savings of 2× compared to a static system and an extra savings of 22{\%} compared to a traditional nonorthogonal adaptive system. {\textcopyright} 2004-2012 IEEE.},

On the other hand, due to aggressive technology scaling, there are plenty of digital transistors available that can be used to simplify testing of Analog/Mixed-Signal (AMS) and RF devices. In this paper, an RF test methodology is developed that: (a) allows RF devices to be tested for several distortion specifications using distortion model fitting algorithms in test time comparable to what can be achieved using supervised learning techniques while retaining the accuracy of direct specification measurement, (b) allows multiple RF specifications to be determined concurrently from a single data acquisition and (c) allows digitalcompatible testing/BIST to be performed using digital testers or on-chip built in self-test (BIST) circuitry.With regard to (a), a key benefit is that no training of supervised learning algorithm is necessary.

A low profile connector with a high density cable assembly ensure a data rate of up to 32 Gb/s per lane while maintaining channel loss below 25 dB. Channel equalization is performed by a combination of a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE), single-stage continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a 6-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE). Collaborative timing recovery is used to enable lane characterization without degrading jitter performance. Phase error decimation, with a conditional phase detection scheme, is used to reduce the DFE complexity by 50{\%}. Power consumption over a wide range of data rates from 4 to 32 Gb/s is reduced by using regulated CMOS clocking with lane bundling, low swing transmitter with a source-series terminated (SST) driver and a highly reconfigurable receiver with an active inductor CTLE. At a lane data rate of 32 Gb/s, over a 0.5 m cable with 16 dB of loss, a transceiver lane consumes 205 mW from a 1.07 V supply. The power scales down to 26 mW from a 0.72 V supply at 8 Gb/s, when transmitting over a channel with 8 dB loss. The active silicon area per lane is 0.079 mm2.},

This results in significantly higher power consumption over most of the operational period since the worst case channels are not statistically prevalent. Adaptive systems solve this problem by adapting the performance and power consumption depending on channel conditions. In this paper, it is demonstrated that depending upon the throughput requirements of the system multiple low-power adaptation modes can be designed. These modes ensure either highest throughput operation or lowest energy-per-bit operation. The operation of these modes is demonstrated in simulation using multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) receiver and transmitter front ends. Subsequently, the concepts are demonstrated in hardware for both MIMO and single-input-single-output front ends.},

The resulting signal is mapped to a digital signature, such that the Hamming Distance between the observed and the golden signature represents the degree by which the circuit specifications (Gain, IIP3, EVM, etc) differ from the ideal. A hardware driven algorithm is used to minimize this Hamming Distance to concurrently optimize (tune) multiple RF specifications. As opposed to prior research, the method does not require the use of an on-chip digital signal processor and uses minimal on-chip hardware.

It is also known that the optimal power control strategy depends on the process conditions corresponding to the RF devices concerned. This leads to an explosion in the search space needed to find the best feedback control strategy, across all combinations of channel conditions and receiver process corners, making simulation driven optimal control law design impractical and computationally infeasible. Since this problem is largely intractable due to the above complexity of simulation, we propose a self-learning strategy for adaptive RF systems. In this approach, RF devices learn their own performance vs. power consumption vs. tuning knob relationships 'on-the-fly' and formulate the most power-optimal control strategy for real-time adaptation of the RF system using neural-network based learning techniques during real-time operation. The methodology is demonstrated using SISO and MIMO RF receiver front-ends as test vehicles and is supported by hardware validation leading to 2.5X-3X power savings with minimal overhead.},

Radio frequency (RF) Polar transceivers are desirable for portable devices due to higher power efficiency compared to traditional RF Cartesian transceivers. Unfortunately, their design is quite challenging due to substantially different signal paths that need to work coherently to ensure signal quality. In the receiver, phase and gain mismatches degrade sensitivity and error vector magnitude. In the transmitter, delay skew between the envelope and phase signals and the finite envelope bandwidth can create intermodulation distortion, which leads to violation of spectral mask requirements. Typically, these parameters are not directly measured but calibrated through spectral analysis using expensive RF equipment, leading to lengthy and costly measurement/calibration cycles. However, characterization and calibration of these parameters with analytical model would reduce the test time and cost considerably. In this article, we propose a technique to measure with the intent to calibrate impairments of the polar transceiver in the loop-back mode. Simulation and hardware measurement results show that the proposed technique can characterize the targeted impairments accurately.},

It is also important to identify whether most of the loss is due to propagation through human body (forward path), or the lack of common ground among the communicating devices. Our experiments show that along with frequency dependence, multiple other factors, such as excitation/termination modality, electrode area, and pressure, significantly affect HBC loss. In this letter, we focus on measuring human body loss with common ground up to 1 MHz (iThe., megabits of data rate using broadband signaling), and investigate the effects of abovementioned variation sources. Our experiments show: 1) high-impedance termination along with voltage-mode communication maximizes received signal; 2) in capacitive HBC, the forward path loss is significantly lower (average: 0.5 dB and variation: 0.5 dB) compared to the return path loss due to noncommon ground; 3) variation in excitation/termination dependent losses explained by a simplified lumped HBC model; and 4) the effect of coupler area/pressure on forward-path channel loss in common ground scenario.},

The existing power SCA countermeasures are mainly based on reducing the SNR of the leaked information, power balancing, or gate-level masking, each of which introduces significant power, area or performance overheads, which calls for an efficient generic countermeasure. This paper presents ASNI: Attenuated Signature Noise Injection, which is an energy-efficient generic countermeasure, and shows SCA resistance on the AES-128 encryption as an application. ASNI uses a shunt low-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by {\textgreater}200 × in the supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in 130 nm CMOS technology.

                abstract = {Energy management of heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) has become a primary concern for residential and commercial buildings. In order to save energy without compromising the comfort of occupants, various techniques have been explored to sense the real-time occupancy/vacancy of HVAC zones. Among all these approaches, wireless-camera-based sensing stands out for its potential application in surveillance and security in addition to energy management. However, limited lifetime and detection accuracy have prevented pervasiveness of wireless-camera-based occupancy detection. This paper presents a novel wireless device platform and prototype development that incorporates an infrared (IR) camera with an optical (OP) camera to provide collaborative intelligence at low power and enhanced accuracy. Compared to the single-sensor baseline design, the proposed fusion-based OP/IR design demonstrates 5× miss rate improvement, 5× reduction in false positive rate, and 3× lifetime extension for battery usage with respect to a single-sensor-based design. Compared to a programmed thermostat and schedule-based HVAC control, the design saves a maximum of 26$\backslash${\%} of HVAC energy.},

                abstract = {Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC), which suffer from key-recovery attacks. State-of-the-art Internet of Things networks such as Nest also use open authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs), on the other hand, can exploit manufacturing process variations to uniquely identify silicon chips which makes a PUF-based system extremely robust and secure at low cost, as it is practically impossible to replicate the same silicon characteristics across dies. Taking inspiration from human communication,
                which utilizes inherent variations in the voice signatures to identify a certain speaker, we present RF-PUF: a deep neural network-based framework that allows real-time authentication of wireless nodes, using the effects of inherent process variation on RF properties of the wireless transmitters (Tx), detected through in-situ machine learning at the receiver (Rx) end. The proposed method utilizes the already-existing asymmetric RF communication framework and does not require any additional circuitry for PUF generation or feature extraction. The burden of device identification is completely shifted to the gateway Rx, similar to the operation of a human listener's brain. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65-nm technology node, and features such as local oscillator offset and I - Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 Tx(s) with an accuracy of 99.9{\%} [≈99{\%} for 10000 Tx(s)]
                under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles. The proposed scheme can be used as a stand-alone security feature, or as a part of traditional multifactor authentication.},

Power-performance scaling limits of the low noise amplifier and frequency translation element are individually identified. Architectural level tuning by switching between operating modes are implemented to overcome single RF functional block's adaptivity range bottleneck. For an EQ-scalable MedRadio receiver operating at 400 MHz, designed in a 65-nm TSMC CMOS process, two decades of tradeoff in power consumption and input referred noise are achieved through circuit and architecture-level reconfigurations. A wide-range of energy-scalability (16$\mu$W to 1 mW) is demonstrated as noise figure varies from 28 to 9 dB.},

                abstract = {Human body communication (HBC) has emerged as an alternative to radio wave communication for connecting low power, miniaturized wearable, and implantable devices in, on, and around the human body. HBC uses the human body as the communication channel between on-body devices. Previous studies characterizing the human body channel has reported widely varying channel response much of which has been attributed to the variation in measurement setup. This calls for the development of a unifying bio-physical model of HBC, supported by in-depth analysis and an understanding of the effect of excitation, termination modality on HBC measurements. This paper characterizes the human body channel up to 1 MHz frequency to evaluate it as a medium for the broadband communication. The communication occurs primarily in the electro-quasistatic (EQS) regime at these frequencies through the subcutaneous tissues. A lumped bio-physical model of HBC is developed, supported by experimental validations that provide insight into some of the key discrepancies found in previous studies. Voltage loss measurements are carried out both with an oscilloscope and a miniaturized wearable prototype to capture the effects of non-common ground. Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4 dB variation in average loss for different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement. The measured channel response with capacitive termination reduces low-frequency
                loss and allows flat-band transfer function down to 13 KHz, establishing the human body as a broadband communication channel. Analysis of the measured results and the simulation model shows that instruments with 50 $\Omega$ input impedance (Vector Network Analyzer, Spectrum Analyzer) provides pessimistic estimation of channel loss at low frequencies. Instead, high impedance and capacitive termination should be used at the receiver end for accurate voltage mode loss measurements of the HBC channel at low frequencies. The experimentally
                validated bio-physical model shows that capacitive voltage mode termination can improve the low frequency loss by up to 50 dB, which helps broadband communication significantly.},

                abstract = {With the advent of cheap computing through five decades of continued miniaturization following Moore's Law, wearable devices are becoming increasingly popular. These wearable devices are typically interconnected using wireless body area network (WBAN). Human body communication (HBC) provides an alternate energy-efficient communication technique between on-body wearable devices by using the human body as a conducting medium. This allows order of magnitude lower communication power, compared to WBAN, due to lower loss and broadband signaling. Moreover, HBC is significantly more secure than WBAN, as the information is contained within the human body and cannot be snooped on unless the person is physically touched. In this paper, we highlight applications of HBC as (1) Social Networking (e.g. LinkedIn/Facebook friend request sent during Handshaking in a meeting/party), (2) Secure Authentication using human-human or human-machine dynamic HBC and (3) ultra-low power, secure BAN using intra-human HBC. One of the biggest technical bottlenecks of HBC has been the interference (e.g. FM) picked up by the human body acting like an antenna. In this work for the first time, we introduce an integrating dual data rate (DDR) receiver technique, that allows notch filtering ({\textgreater}20 dB) of the interference for interference-robust HBC.},
