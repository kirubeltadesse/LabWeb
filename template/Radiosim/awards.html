The Intel Corporation Ph.D. Fellowship Program awards fellowships to outstanding Ph.D. candidates pursuing leading-edge work in fields related to Engineering, Computer Science and other technical majors focusing on semiconductor technologies, micro-architecture, Software Technology and Design, and communications. Select U.S. universities are invited to submit a limited number of students for consideration. Those students selected by their university are then carefully reviewed by the Intel fellows and their designees who choose the winning students. This is a highly competitive program with a limited number of fellowships awarded annually. Students in these programs are prioritized for receiving internships. The students in the Ph.D. fellowship program are provided with the opportunity to meet their designated Intel Technical Liaison face to face either at a conference or here at Intel. The award consists of academic year tuition for 2010-2011, a $24,000 stipend and a $1,500 travel grant.
